The Firebase SDK might throw an error if you attempt to access a database reference before the connection to the database has been successfully established.  This commonly occurs when you try to perform read or write operations immediately after initializing the Firebase app. The asynchronous nature of Firebase operations means that the initialization might not have completed by the time your code tries to interact with the database. For example:

```javascript
// Incorrect - Accessing the database before initialization is complete
firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
const db = firebase.firestore();
db.collection('myCollection').add({name: 'test'});
```

This will likely result in an error because `db.collection('myCollection').add({name: 'test'})` is executed before the `initializeApp` promise resolves.
